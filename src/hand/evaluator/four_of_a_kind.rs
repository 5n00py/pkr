/// Finds "Four of a Kind" in a hand of poker cards.

/// The function takes a vector of Rank sorted in descending order.

/// If the hand has less than five cards, it returns None, except when the hand
/// consists of four cards of the same rank.
/// When a "four of a kind" is found, it returns a vector consisting of two ranks:
/// The first represents the value of the four of a kind, and the second
/// represents the highest card that is not part of the four of a kind (kicker).
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `mut ranks` - A mutable vector of Rank representing the ranks of a hand
/// of cards in descending order.
